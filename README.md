I'm utilizing Yamnet to craft a scalable audio classification solution for construction noises, seamlessly connecting with IoT devices. This full-stack approach incorporates a user-friendly front-end website for real-time monitoring, complete with data visualization options to analyze sound signatures. Moreover, the system offers the flexibility of retraining the model, enhancing adaptability. The solution will be deployed on Heroku, ensuring accessibility and scalability across diverse construction scenarios. The objective is to create an efficient, deployable, and user-friendly system with robust capabilities for sound analysis and model refinement.
